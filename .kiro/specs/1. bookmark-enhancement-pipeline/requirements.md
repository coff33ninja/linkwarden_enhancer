# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive bookmark data enhancement pipeline that automatically improves titles, generates descriptions, adds intelligent tags, and removes duplicates. The system will transform raw bookmark data into enriched, well-organized bookmarks through AI-powered analysis and content extraction, significantly improving the utility and discoverability of bookmark collections.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user with poorly formatted bookmark titles, I want the system to automatically enhance and clean my bookmark titles, so that I can easily identify and find my bookmarks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system encounters generic titles THEN it SHALL scrape the actual page title from the URL
2. WHEN processing titles THEN it SHALL remove site names, clean formatting, and standardize title structure
3. WHEN a title is just a URL or domain name THEN it SHALL generate a meaningful title from page content
4. WHEN title quality is assessed THEN it SHALL score titles based on length, descriptiveness, and formatting
5. WHEN multiple title sources are available THEN it SHALL prioritize the most descriptive and informative title

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user with untagged bookmarks, I want the system to automatically generate relevant tags based on content analysis, so that I can organize and discover my bookmarks more effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing bookmark content THEN the system SHALL extract tags from URL structure, domain, and path patterns
2. WHEN processing page content THEN it SHALL use NLP-based keyword extraction to generate relevant tags
3. WHEN encountering specific domains THEN it SHALL apply domain-specific tagging rules for gaming, development, research, etc.
4. WHEN detecting technology content THEN it SHALL identify programming languages, frameworks, and tools for accurate tagging
5. WHEN generating tags THEN it SHALL limit to 10-15 tags per bookmark and remove overly generic tags
6. WHEN multiple tag sources exist THEN it SHALL provide confidence scoring for each generated tag

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user with bookmarks lacking descriptions, I want the system to create meaningful descriptions automatically, so that I can understand what each bookmark contains without visiting it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a bookmark lacks a description THEN the system SHALL extract meta descriptions from the page
2. WHEN meta descriptions are unavailable THEN it SHALL generate AI-powered content summaries using local LLM
3. WHEN existing user descriptions exist THEN it SHALL preserve them and not override user content
4. WHEN generating descriptions THEN it SHALL maintain consistent length between 100-200 characters
5. WHEN multiple description sources are available THEN it SHALL prioritize in order: user description, meta description, AI summary, content snippet

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user with duplicate bookmarks from multiple sources, I want advanced duplicate detection that identifies similar content across different URLs, so that I can maintain a clean, organized bookmark collection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN comparing bookmarks THEN the system SHALL normalize URLs for accurate comparison
2. WHEN detecting duplicates THEN it SHALL use semantic similarity for titles and content comparison
3. WHEN calculating similarity THEN it SHALL combine URL, title, and content similarity metrics
4. WHEN duplicates are found THEN it SHALL group them and suggest resolution strategies
5. WHEN resolving duplicates THEN it SHALL offer merge, user choice, quality-based, and recency-based resolution options
6. WHEN merging duplicates THEN it SHALL combine tags and preserve the best title and description

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user processing large bookmark collections, I want the enhancement pipeline to handle errors gracefully and provide detailed progress tracking, so that I can monitor the process and recover from failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN enhancement fails for individual bookmarks THEN the system SHALL continue processing other bookmarks
2. WHEN processing large datasets THEN it SHALL provide real-time progress indicators with completion percentages
3. WHEN errors occur THEN it SHALL log detailed error information and continue with graceful degradation
4. WHEN processing in batches THEN it SHALL implement error recovery and isolation for failed batches
5. WHEN enhancement completes THEN it SHALL generate comprehensive reports showing success rates and improvements

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user wanting control over the enhancement process, I want configurable enhancement settings and selective processing options, so that I can customize the enhancement to my specific needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running enhancement THEN the system SHALL support selective enhancement of titles, tags, descriptions, or duplicates
2. WHEN configuring enhancement THEN it SHALL allow custom thresholds for title quality, tag confidence, and similarity detection
3. WHEN processing bookmarks THEN it SHALL respect user preferences for preserving existing data
4. WHEN enhancement is enabled THEN it SHALL provide dry-run mode to preview changes without applying them
5. WHEN generating reports THEN it SHALL provide detailed metrics on enhancement quality and performance

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user with diverse bookmark content, I want the system to handle different content types intelligently, so that gaming, development, research, and other specialized content receives appropriate enhancement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing gaming content THEN the system SHALL recognize gaming platforms, genres, and tools for specialized tagging
2. WHEN analyzing development resources THEN it SHALL identify programming languages, frameworks, and development tools
3. WHEN encountering research content THEN it SHALL extract academic topics, paper types, and research domains
4. WHEN processing news and articles THEN it SHALL identify publication sources, topics, and content categories
5. WHEN handling multimedia content THEN it SHALL extract relevant metadata and categorization information

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user concerned about data integrity, I want the enhancement process to maintain data safety and provide rollback capabilities, so that my original bookmark data is never lost.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting enhancement THEN the system SHALL create backups of original bookmark data
2. WHEN processing fails THEN it SHALL provide rollback capabilities to restore original state
3. WHEN enhancement completes THEN it SHALL validate data integrity and completeness
4. WHEN errors occur THEN it SHALL maintain detailed logs for troubleshooting and recovery
5. WHEN processing large datasets THEN it SHALL implement checkpointing for recovery from interruptions
