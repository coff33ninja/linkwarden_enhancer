# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive environment configuration management system for multi-platform bookmark manager integration. The system will provide secure credential storage, validation, and management for multiple bookmark platforms including Linkwarden, Raindrop.io, Pocket, Pinboard, and Wallabag, with support for enhancement settings, sync configurations, and performance tuning.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

5. WHEN the wizard finishes THEN the system SHALL validate the complete configuration and confirm successful setup

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user with multiple bookmark platforms, I want comprehensive environment variable support for all platforms and features, so that I can configure the system through environment variables or configuration files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring platforms THEN the system SHALL support environment variables for Linkwarden, Raindrop.io, Pocket, Pinboard, and Wallabag
2. WHEN setting enhancement options THEN the system SHALL provide environment variables for title enhancement, auto-tagging, description generation, and duplicate detection
3. WHEN configuring AI features THEN the system SHALL support Ollama settings, content analysis options, and machine learning parameters
4. WHEN setting sync options THEN the system SHALL provide variables for sync strategies, conflict resolution, and safety settings
5. WHEN configuring performance THEN the system SHALL support variables for concurrency, timeouts, caching, and resource limits

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user concerned about security, I want secure credential storage and management, so that my API keys and passwords are protected from unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing credentials THEN the system SHALL encrypt sensitive data using strong encryption algorithms
2. WHEN accessing credentials THEN the system SHALL decrypt them only when needed for API operations
3. WHEN configuration files are created THEN the system SHALL set appropriate file permissions to restrict access
4. WHEN credentials are detected in plain text THEN the system SHALL warn users and offer encryption options
5. WHEN security issues are found THEN the system SHALL provide detailed security recommendations and remediation steps

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user managing complex configurations, I want comprehensive validation and testing of all configuration settings, so that I can identify and fix configuration issues before running operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validating configuration THEN the system SHALL check all required variables are present and properly formatted
2. WHEN testing API connections THEN the system SHALL verify connectivity and authentication for all configured platforms
3. WHEN validating numeric settings THEN the system SHALL ensure values are within acceptable ranges
4. WHEN checking enum values THEN the system SHALL verify choices are from allowed options
5. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages with suggested corrections

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user with different deployment environments, I want flexible configuration management that supports multiple configuration sources and environment-specific settings, so that I can use the same system across development, testing, and production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading configuration THEN the system SHALL support both .env files and direct environment variables
2. WHEN multiple configuration sources exist THEN the system SHALL merge them with proper precedence rules
3. WHEN environment-specific settings are needed THEN the system SHALL support configuration profiles or environment prefixes
4. WHEN configuration changes THEN the system SHALL provide export/import capabilities for backup and sharing
5. WHEN migrating configurations THEN the system SHALL support configuration format upgrades and migration tools

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user wanting to optimize performance, I want comprehensive performance and resource configuration options, so that I can tune the system for my specific hardware and network conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring concurrency THEN the system SHALL allow setting maximum concurrent requests and worker counts
2. WHEN setting timeouts THEN the system SHALL support configurable timeouts for API requests, scraping, and processing
3. WHEN configuring caching THEN the system SHALL provide cache TTL, size limits, and cache directory settings
4. WHEN setting resource limits THEN the system SHALL support memory limits, batch sizes, and processing chunk sizes
5. WHEN optimizing performance THEN the system SHALL provide retry logic, rate limiting, and parallel processing controls

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user troubleshooting issues, I want comprehensive logging and debugging configuration options, so that I can diagnose problems and monitor system behavior effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring logging THEN the system SHALL support multiple log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
2. WHEN setting log outputs THEN the system SHALL support both console and file logging with rotation
3. WHEN debugging issues THEN the system SHALL provide verbose logging options for detailed troubleshooting
4. WHEN handling sensitive data THEN the system SHALL offer options to exclude sensitive information from logs
5. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the system SHALL support API request logging and performance metrics collection

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user managing team configurations, I want configuration templates and sharing capabilities, so that I can standardize configurations across multiple users or deployments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating templates THEN the system SHALL support configuration templates with placeholder values
2. WHEN sharing configurations THEN the system SHALL provide export functionality that excludes sensitive credentials
3. WHEN importing configurations THEN the system SHALL merge imported settings with existing configurations safely
4. WHEN using templates THEN the system SHALL validate template completeness and prompt for missing values
5. WHEN managing multiple configurations THEN the system SHALL support configuration versioning and rollback capabilities

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user with specific platform requirements, I want platform-specific configuration validation and optimization, so that each bookmark platform is configured optimally for its specific API characteristics and limitations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring Linkwarden THEN the system SHALL validate URL format, API key format, and test basic connectivity
2. WHEN setting up Raindrop.io THEN the system SHALL validate API token format and test API access permissions
3. WHEN configuring Pocket THEN the system SHALL validate consumer key and access token pair and test authentication
4. WHEN setting up Pinboard THEN the system SHALL validate API token format and test rate limit compliance
5. WHEN configuring Wallabag THEN the system SHALL validate OAuth credentials and test full authentication flow

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a user running the system in different environments, I want automatic environment detection and configuration recommendations, so that the system can optimize itself for different deployment scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN detecting the environment THEN the system SHALL identify development, testing, and production environments
2. WHEN recommending settings THEN the system SHALL suggest appropriate configurations for detected environments
3. WHEN resource constraints are detected THEN the system SHALL recommend performance settings suitable for available resources
4. WHEN network conditions vary THEN the system SHALL suggest timeout and retry settings appropriate for network quality
5. WHEN security requirements differ THEN the system SHALL recommend security settings appropriate for the environment type
