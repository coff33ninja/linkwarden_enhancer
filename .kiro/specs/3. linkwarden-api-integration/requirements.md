# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements comprehensive Linkwarden API integration for direct import/export and bidirectional sync capabilities. The system will provide seamless integration with Linkwarden instances through REST API endpoints, enabling users to import bookmarks, enhance them with AI-powered analysis, and sync the enhanced data back to Linkwarden while maintaining data integrity and supporting various sync strategies.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user with a Linkwarden instance, I want to connect to my Linkwarden API using my instance URL and API key, so that I can import and export my bookmark data programmatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring Linkwarden connection THEN the system SHALL accept instance URL and API key from environment variables
2. WHEN testing connection THEN the system SHALL validate API key authentication and instance accessibility
3. WHEN connection fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with troubleshooting suggestions
4. WHEN API rate limits are encountered THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff and retry logic
5. WHEN connection is established THEN the system SHALL maintain session state for efficient API operations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user importing from Linkwarden, I want to retrieve all my bookmarks, collections, and tags through the API, so that I can work with my complete bookmark dataset locally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing bookmarks THEN the system SHALL retrieve all links with complete metadata (title, URL, description, tags, collections)
2. WHEN importing collections THEN the system SHALL preserve collection hierarchy and relationships
3. WHEN importing tags THEN the system SHALL maintain tag associations and metadata
4. WHEN handling large datasets THEN the system SHALL implement pagination and batch processing
5. WHEN import completes THEN the system SHALL provide detailed import statistics and any error reports

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user enhancing my bookmarks, I want to import from Linkwarden, apply AI enhancements, and export the enhanced data back, so that my Linkwarden instance contains improved bookmark metadata.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing for enhancement THEN the system SHALL support selective import of specific collections or date ranges
2. WHEN applying enhancements THEN the system SHALL preserve original user data while adding AI-generated improvements
3. WHEN exporting enhanced data THEN the system SHALL update existing bookmarks and create missing collections as needed
4. WHEN conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL provide merge strategies to handle data conflicts intelligently
5. WHEN enhancement completes THEN the system SHALL generate detailed reports showing improvements made

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user managing bookmark data, I want bidirectional sync between my local enhanced data and Linkwarden, so that changes in either location are synchronized while preserving enhancements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing bidirectional sync THEN the system SHALL detect changes in both local and remote data
2. WHEN conflicts are detected THEN the system SHALL provide interactive or automatic conflict resolution options
3. WHEN syncing enhanced data THEN the system SHALL preserve AI-generated tags and descriptions alongside user modifications
4. WHEN sync completes THEN the system SHALL ensure data consistency between local and remote instances
5. WHEN sync fails THEN the system SHALL provide rollback capabilities to restore previous state

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user with specific sync requirements, I want configurable sync strategies and merge options, so that I can control how data is combined and conflicts are resolved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring sync THEN the system SHALL support multiple merge strategies (smart merge, source priority, target priority, user choice)
2. WHEN handling conflicts THEN the system SHALL allow automatic resolution for low-risk conflicts and interactive resolution for complex cases
3. WHEN preserving user data THEN the system SHALL maintain user tags and descriptions while adding AI enhancements
4. WHEN backup is enabled THEN the system SHALL create backups before sync operations with rollback capabilities
5. WHEN sync strategies are applied THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logs of all merge decisions and data changes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user working with large bookmark collections, I want efficient batch processing and progress tracking, so that I can monitor long-running operations and handle large datasets effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing large datasets THEN the system SHALL implement batch processing with configurable batch sizes
2. WHEN operations are running THEN the system SHALL provide real-time progress indicators with completion estimates
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL continue processing other items and provide detailed error reports
4. WHEN rate limits are hit THEN the system SHALL automatically throttle requests and implement appropriate delays
5. WHEN operations complete THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive statistics on success rates and performance metrics

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user concerned about data integrity, I want comprehensive error handling and data validation, so that my bookmark data is never corrupted or lost during API operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL implement comprehensive error handling with specific error types and recovery strategies
2. WHEN data validation fails THEN the system SHALL reject invalid data and provide detailed validation error messages
3. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff and connection recovery
4. WHEN operations fail THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity and provide rollback capabilities
5. WHEN validation succeeds THEN the system SHALL ensure all imported/exported data maintains referential integrity

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user integrating with existing workflows, I want comprehensive CLI commands for all Linkwarden operations, so that I can automate bookmark management tasks and integrate with scripts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using import commands THEN the system SHALL support various import options (all data, specific collections, date ranges, with/without enhancement)
2. WHEN using export commands THEN the system SHALL support exporting enhanced data back to Linkwarden with update and creation options
3. WHEN using sync commands THEN the system SHALL provide bidirectional sync with configurable strategies and conflict resolution
4. WHEN running commands THEN the system SHALL provide verbose logging options and detailed progress reporting
5. WHEN commands complete THEN the system SHALL return appropriate exit codes and generate operation reports

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user with multiple Linkwarden instances or environments, I want support for multiple instance configurations, so that I can work with development, testing, and production Linkwarden deployments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring multiple instances THEN the system SHALL support named instance profiles with separate credentials
2. WHEN switching between instances THEN the system SHALL allow profile selection through CLI parameters or environment variables
3. WHEN managing instances THEN the system SHALL provide instance listing, validation, and connection testing capabilities
4. WHEN syncing between instances THEN the system SHALL support cross-instance sync and migration operations
5. WHEN instances have different versions THEN the system SHALL handle API version differences and feature compatibility

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a user monitoring API operations, I want detailed logging and monitoring capabilities, so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor the health of API integrations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API operations run THEN the system SHALL log all API requests and responses with configurable detail levels
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error logging with context and suggested remediation
3. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the system SHALL track API response times, success rates, and throughput metrics
4. WHEN debugging issues THEN the system SHALL provide debug mode with enhanced logging and request/response inspection
5. WHEN operations complete THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive operation reports with statistics and recommendations
