# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive bidirectional sync and intelligent merge system for bookmark data across multiple platforms with conflict resolution and data integrity guarantees. The system will provide seamless synchronization between any two supported platforms, intelligent merging of bookmark data from multiple sources, advanced conflict detection and resolution, and comprehensive data integrity validation to ensure no data loss during sync operations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user with bookmarks on multiple platforms, I want bidirectional sync between any two supported platforms, so that changes made on either platform are automatically synchronized while preserving data integrity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing bidirectional sync THEN the system SHALL detect changes in both source and target platforms since last sync
2. WHEN changes are detected THEN the system SHALL apply changes in both directions while preserving data relationships
3. WHEN sync completes THEN the system SHALL ensure both platforms have consistent data with all changes applied
4. WHEN sync fails THEN the system SHALL provide rollback capabilities to restore previous state
5. WHEN sync succeeds THEN the system SHALL update sync timestamps and maintain sync state for future incremental operations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user with conflicting changes on different platforms, I want intelligent conflict detection and resolution, so that conflicts are resolved appropriately without losing important data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN conflicts are detected THEN the system SHALL classify conflicts by type (URL, title, tags, collection, deletion) and severity
2. WHEN conflicts have high confidence resolution THEN the system SHALL resolve them automatically using intelligent rules
3. WHEN conflicts require user input THEN the system SHALL provide interactive resolution with clear options and recommendations
4. WHEN conflicts are resolved THEN the system SHALL track resolution decisions for learning and future automation
5. WHEN conflict resolution completes THEN the system SHALL ensure all conflicts are addressed before proceeding with sync

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user wanting control over sync behavior, I want multiple merge strategies and sync options, so that I can customize how data is combined and conflicts are handled based on my preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring sync THEN the system SHALL support multiple merge strategies (smart merge, source priority, target priority, user choice)
2. WHEN using smart merge THEN the system SHALL intelligently combine data preserving the best information from both sources
3. WHEN using priority strategies THEN the system SHALL consistently prefer data from the specified source while preserving non-conflicting changes
4. WHEN conflicts require user choice THEN the system SHALL provide interactive selection with preview of merge results
5. WHEN merge strategies are applied THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logs of all merge decisions and data transformations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user with enhanced bookmark data, I want sync operations to preserve AI-generated improvements, so that enhancements are maintained across platforms while respecting user modifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN syncing enhanced data THEN the system SHALL preserve AI-generated tags, descriptions, and metadata improvements
2. WHEN user modifications conflict with enhancements THEN the system SHALL prioritize user changes while preserving non-conflicting enhancements
3. WHEN merging enhanced bookmarks THEN the system SHALL combine AI improvements with user modifications intelligently
4. WHEN enhancement conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL provide options to keep enhancements, user changes, or merge both
5. WHEN sync completes THEN the system SHALL maintain enhancement metadata for tracking AI-generated content

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user managing large bookmark collections, I want incremental sync capabilities, so that only changes since the last sync are processed for efficient and fast synchronization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing incremental sync THEN the system SHALL identify and process only items modified since last sync timestamp
2. WHEN change detection runs THEN the system SHALL use timestamps, checksums, and content hashes to identify modifications
3. WHEN incremental sync completes THEN the system SHALL be significantly faster than full sync for large collections
4. WHEN sync state is corrupted THEN the system SHALL fall back to full sync with user notification
5. WHEN incremental sync succeeds THEN the system SHALL update sync state and prepare for next incremental operation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user concerned about data safety, I want comprehensive backup and rollback capabilities, so that I can recover from failed or unsatisfactory sync operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sync begins THEN the system SHALL create backups of both source and target data before making changes
2. WHEN backup creation fails THEN the system SHALL halt sync operation and report the error
3. WHEN sync fails or produces unsatisfactory results THEN the system SHALL provide rollback to restore original state
4. WHEN rollback is requested THEN the system SHALL restore data from backups and validate restoration success
5. WHEN backup retention is managed THEN the system SHALL maintain configurable number of backup versions with automatic cleanup

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user monitoring sync operations, I want detailed progress tracking and comprehensive reporting, so that I can understand what changes were made and monitor sync performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sync operations run THEN the system SHALL provide real-time progress indicators with current operation and completion percentage
2. WHEN sync completes THEN the system SHALL generate detailed reports showing all changes made, conflicts resolved, and statistics
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive error reporting with context and suggested remediation
4. WHEN sync performance varies THEN the system SHALL track and report performance metrics for optimization
5. WHEN sync history is needed THEN the system SHALL maintain sync logs and statistics for analysis and troubleshooting

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user with complex sync requirements, I want advanced sync features like selective sync and sync scheduling, so that I can control what data is synchronized and when operations occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring selective sync THEN the system SHALL support syncing specific collections, tags, or date ranges
2. WHEN scheduling sync operations THEN the system SHALL support automated sync at specified intervals or triggers
3. WHEN sync filters are applied THEN the system SHALL respect filter criteria while maintaining data relationships
4. WHEN sync conditions are met THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger sync operations with appropriate notifications
5. WHEN selective sync completes THEN the system SHALL provide reports on what was included/excluded and why

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user integrating sync with workflows, I want comprehensive CLI commands and automation support, so that I can integrate sync operations with scripts and automated processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using sync commands THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive CLI with all sync options and strategies
2. WHEN automating sync THEN the system SHALL support non-interactive mode with configuration-based conflict resolution
3. WHEN chaining operations THEN the system SHALL support sync as part of larger bookmark management workflows
4. WHEN monitoring automated sync THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate exit codes and machine-readable output
5. WHEN sync commands execute THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logging and reporting suitable for automation

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a user managing sync across multiple platform pairs, I want sync state management and coordination, so that I can maintain multiple sync relationships without conflicts or data corruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing multiple sync pairs THEN the system SHALL maintain separate sync state for each platform combination
2. WHEN sync states conflict THEN the system SHALL detect and resolve sync state conflicts to prevent data corruption
3. WHEN sync coordination is needed THEN the system SHALL prevent simultaneous conflicting sync operations
4. WHEN sync state is corrupted THEN the system SHALL provide sync state repair and recovery capabilities
5. WHEN sync relationships change THEN the system SHALL provide migration tools for updating sync configurations and state
