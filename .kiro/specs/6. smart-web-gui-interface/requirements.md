# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a smart web-based GUI interface for the Linkwarden Enhancer system using FastAPI backend with HTML/JS/CSS frontend. The interface will provide an intuitive web dashboard that auto-populates functionality from the existing CLI, includes text input fields for data entry, and provides import/export capabilities. The system will eliminate the need for Node.js by using FastAPI for the backend and vanilla JavaScript for the frontend, creating a lightweight, self-contained web interface.
