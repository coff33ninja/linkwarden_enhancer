# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing Linkwarden bookmark cleanup script with comprehensive safety checks and validation mechanisms to ensure no bookmarks are lost during the cleanup process. The enhancement will add pre-processing validation, detailed backup strategies, rollback capabilities, and comprehensive reporting to provide users with confidence that their bookmark data remains intact throughout the cleanup operation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user running the bookmark cleanup script, I want comprehensive data validation before any modifications are made, so that I can be confident no bookmarks will be lost due to data corruption or script errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the script starts THEN it SHALL validate the input JSON structure against expected schema
2. WHEN validation detects missing required fields THEN the script SHALL report specific issues and halt execution
3. WHEN validation detects data inconsistencies THEN the script SHALL log detailed warnings with affected record IDs
4. WHEN validation passes THEN the script SHALL create a detailed inventory of all bookmarks, tags, and collections before processing

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want multiple backup strategies with different retention levels, so that I can recover my data from various points in the cleanup process if something goes wrong.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the script runs THEN it SHALL create a timestamped backup of the original file before any modifications
2. WHEN each major operation begins THEN the script SHALL create an incremental backup with operation name in filename
3. WHEN the script completes THEN it SHALL maintain the last 5 backups and archive older ones
4. WHEN backup creation fails THEN the script SHALL halt execution and report the error

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want detailed before-and-after comparison reports, so that I can verify exactly what changes were made and ensure no data was lost.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing completes THEN the script SHALL generate a detailed diff report showing all changes
2. WHEN bookmarks are modified THEN the report SHALL show original and new values side-by-side
3. WHEN items are removed THEN the report SHALL list all removed items with full details for verification
4. WHEN the report is generated THEN it SHALL include summary statistics of total items before and after processing

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want automatic rollback capability, so that I can quickly restore my original data if the cleanup results are not satisfactory.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the script completes THEN it SHALL provide a rollback command that can restore the original state
2. WHEN rollback is requested THEN the system SHALL restore from the most recent complete backup
3. WHEN rollback completes THEN the system SHALL verify data integrity and report success or failure
4. IF rollback fails THEN the system SHALL provide manual recovery instructions with backup file locations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want real-time progress monitoring with safety checkpoints, so that I can track the cleanup process and intervene if issues are detected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN each operation starts THEN the script SHALL display progress indicators with current operation name
2. WHEN processing large datasets THEN the script SHALL show percentage completion and estimated time remaining
3. WHEN safety thresholds are exceeded THEN the script SHALL pause and request user confirmation to continue
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the script SHALL provide clear error messages with suggested actions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want configurable safety limits and dry-run mode, so that I can test the cleanup process without making actual changes to my data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dry-run mode is enabled THEN the script SHALL simulate all operations without modifying the original data
2. WHEN dry-run completes THEN the script SHALL generate a complete report of what would have been changed
3. WHEN safety limits are configured THEN the script SHALL respect maximum deletion percentages and item count thresholds
4. WHEN limits are exceeded THEN the script SHALL require explicit user confirmation to proceed

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want comprehensive data integrity verification, so that I can be certain the cleanup process maintained all essential bookmark information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing completes THEN the script SHALL verify all bookmark URLs are preserved
2. WHEN verification runs THEN it SHALL confirm all collection relationships remain intact
3. WHEN checking integrity THEN the script SHALL validate that no orphaned links or broken references exist
4. WHEN integrity issues are found THEN the script SHALL provide detailed reports with affected items and suggested fixes

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want AI-powered bookmark analysis and enhancement, so that I can automatically improve my bookmark organization with intelligent suggestions and content understanding.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI analysis is enabled THEN the system SHALL use machine learning models to analyze bookmark content and suggest relevant tags
2. WHEN processing bookmarks THEN the system SHALL detect near-duplicate content using similarity algorithms and suggest consolidation
3. WHEN analyzing large bookmark collections THEN the system SHALL use clustering algorithms to suggest optimal collection organization
4. WHEN AI features are used THEN the system SHALL integrate with local LLM (Ollama) to generate intelligent summaries and category suggestions
5. WHEN content analysis runs THEN the system SHALL extract topics, sentiment, and key concepts using natural language processing
6. WHEN AI processing completes THEN the system SHALL provide detailed reports on AI-suggested improvements with confidence scores

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user with diverse interests ranging from gaming to development to random research, I want intelligent auto-categorization dictionaries that learn from my existing bookmark patterns, so that the system can accurately suggest categories and tags for my eclectic collection of links.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL analyze existing bookmark patterns to build personalized category and tag dictionaries
2. WHEN processing new bookmarks THEN the system SHALL use domain-based classification to suggest appropriate categories (Gaming, Development, AI, etc.)
3. WHEN analyzing bookmark content THEN the system SHALL apply learned patterns from existing tags to suggest relevant new tags
4. WHEN encountering gaming content THEN the system SHALL recognize specific games (like Genshin Impact) and suggest specialized tags and categories
5. WHEN processing development resources THEN the system SHALL identify programming languages, frameworks, and tools for accurate categorization
6. WHEN handling diverse random content THEN the system SHALL use content analysis and learned patterns to provide meaningful categorization suggestions

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a user who continuously adds new bookmarks, I want the system to get smarter over time by learning from my new links and feedback, so that categorization accuracy improves with every use and adapts to my evolving interests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new bookmarks are added THEN the system SHALL automatically learn new domain patterns, tag associations, and categorization preferences
2. WHEN I accept or reject suggestions THEN the system SHALL track this feedback to improve future suggestion accuracy
3. WHEN processing bookmarks over time THEN the system SHALL demonstrate measurable improvement in suggestion quality and relevance
4. WHEN my interests evolve THEN the system SHALL adapt its intelligence to recognize new patterns and domains I bookmark
5. WHEN the system learns new patterns THEN it SHALL maintain backward compatibility while improving suggestions for similar content
6. WHEN learning data accumulates THEN the system SHALL provide export/import capabilities to preserve and share learned intelligence

### Requirement 11

**User Story:** As a developer who stars GitHub repositories and maintains my own projects, I want to import my GitHub stars and repositories as bookmarks, so that I can have a unified view of all my development resources and interests in one intelligent system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN GitHub integration is configured THEN the system SHALL import all starred repositories as development bookmarks
2. WHEN importing repositories THEN the system SHALL automatically detect programming languages, frameworks, and generate relevant tags
3. WHEN processing GitHub data THEN the system SHALL suggest appropriate collections based on repository characteristics (AI/ML, web development, gaming, etc.)
4. WHEN importing repository metadata THEN the system SHALL preserve star counts, fork counts, topics, and creation dates for enhanced categorization
5. WHEN GitHub data is imported THEN the system SHALL use this information to improve its understanding of development patterns and preferences
6. WHEN the original script exists THEN the system SHALL analyze its patterns for reference without modifying the original file
