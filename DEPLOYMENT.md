black --check .
flake8 .
mypy . --ignore-missing-imports
pytest tests/ --cov=linkwarden_enhancer
```

### 2. Update Version Information
- Update version in `setup.py`
- Update version in `__init__.py` if applicable
- Update CHANGELOG.md with release notes

### 3. Clean Repository
```bash
# Remove any temporary files
find . -name "*.pyc" -delete
find . -name "__pycache__" -type d -exec rm -rf {} +
find . -name ".pytest_cache" -type d -exec rm -rf {} +

# Remove any personal data files
rm -rf data/
rm -rf backups/
rm -rf cache/
rm -rf logs/
```

### 4. Test Installation Process

```

### 5. Create Release
```bash
# Create and push tag
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"
git push origin v1.0.0
```

### 6. Verify GitHub Actions
- Check that CI workflow passes
- Verify release workflow creates proper assets
- Test download and installation from release

## üì¶ Release Assets

The release workflow will create:
- `linkwarden-enhancer-v1.0.0.zip` - Source code archive (ZIP)
